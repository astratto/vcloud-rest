### Write new tests

Tests are now managed using VCR and thus real interactions are recorded and replayed.

In order to write new tests the following steps are required:

1. create a file *test_credentials.yml*
1. create a new test entry specifying a new VCR cassette *my_test_case.yml*
1. review and anonymize data if necessary under *spec/fixtures/vcr_cassettes/my_test_case.yml*

**Note:** values in *test_credentials.yml* are automatically anonymized.

Examples:

    => test_credentials.yml
    :host: https://vcloud_instance_url
    :username: test_username
    :password: test_password
    :org: test_organization


    => Test entry in connection_spec.rb
      it "should power off a given vapp" do
        VCR.use_cassette('vapps/poweroff_vapp') do
          connection.login
          task_id = connection.poweroff_vapp("65b4dbc9-b0b1-46e4-a420-8f8147369f8b")
          expect(task_id).to eq "ae791b59-4c9f-4fe2-9916-703f1fc3cbd5"
        end
      end

    => Recorded fixture (credentials auto-anonymized)
